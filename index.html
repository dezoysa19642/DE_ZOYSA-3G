    <h3> ATTEMPTING TO MAKE NEW MAP ‘COMMANDER OF THE BLOCKS’</h3>
    <span class="byline">WRITTEN BY: -----</span>
    <p>I am now currently attempting to make an innovative Minecraft map using in-game commands to introduce coding to players. The map is intended to be free to download, perhaps with a texture pack. The game design will be based off official Realms supported maps.</p>

    <p>The game will be set in simple 8x8 square, with varying objectives. In order for the map to maintain quality - it will be tested, and hopes to be ready by version 1.16. It will involve players making their own minigames varying from ‘Player versus Player’ to ‘Spleef’. This game does not intend to operate for multiplayer. This game may also be updated (or not) based on its popularity.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">
      <h2>"IF DEEMED POPULAR, SEQUELS TO THE “COMMANDER OF THE BLOCKS” WILL FOLLOW."</h2>
    </div>

    <p>If successful, part 2, 3 and 4 might follow. They will be named ‘Controller of the Blocks’, ‘Creator of the Blocks’ and ‘Composer of the Blocks’ respectively. ‘Controller of the Blocks’ will be aimed at teaching Minecrafters how to use redstone, from basics to advanced, with comparisons of real-life engineering and electrics. ‘Creator of the Blocks’ will teach players how to use structure blocks, and the fundamentals of building - using comparisons of real-life architecture. ‘Composer of the Blocks’ will, you guessed it, will focus on music. Teaching players how to use noteblocks, and using references to real-life Garage-Band like applications.</p>

    <p>In terms of technical stuff, the map will attempt to be less than 50MB, however game-speeds may be slow (commands and all that). Beta,  nevertheless will not be open to the public yet. The category of this game will be ‘Educational’ or ‘Puzzle’ on most map websites. The download will most probably be available here, on the maps section of the site. Well… That’d be it! Cheerio!</p>
